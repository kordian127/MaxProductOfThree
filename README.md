# MaxProductOfThree
 
A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The product of triplet (P, Q, R) equates to A[P] * A[Q] * A[R]   
(0 ≤ P < Q < R < N).  
  
For example, array A such that:  
  
  A[0] = -3  
  A[1] = 1  
  A[2] = 2  
  A[3] = -2  
  A[4] = 5  
  A[5] = 6  
contains the following example triplets:  
  
(0, 1, 2), product is −3 * 1 * 2 = −6  
(1, 2, 4), product is 1 * 2 * 5 = 10  
(2, 4, 5), product is 2 * 5 * 6 = 60  
  
Goal is to find the maximal product of any triplet.
